  bnUSD: `Balanced Dollars (bnUSD) is a stablecoin backed by ICX, tied to the value of 1 USD. Itâ€™s the first synthetic asset created on Balanced, and the first stablecoin for the ICON Network. It was created to replace ICX for payments, trades, and in-app purchases within the ICON ecosystem, and beyond.`,
  sICX: `Staked ICX (sICX) is ICX you can move around in a liquid state and still earn staking rewards. Every sICX you hold entitles you to a share of the ICX staking pool, and the value increases over time based on the ICON reward rate.
  <br /><br />
  With sICX, you can unstake faster than traditional ICX unstaking. Pay a 1% premium to swap sICX for ICX, or unstake from the wallet section to join the unstaking queue, which could take anywhere from 5 minutes, up to the regular ICX unstaking time of ~7 days.`,
  BALN: `The Balance Token (BALN) is the Balanced governance token. When staked, it entitles the holder to voting rights and a share of the network fees. You can earn Balance Tokens by using Balanced: either take out a loan, or supply liquidity to the exchange.
  <br /><br />
  The Balance Token supply increases daily: 100,000 BALN is distributed each day for the first 60 days, then it tapers by 0.5% a day until it reaches 1,250 (<2% inflation).`,
  ICX: `ICON is a decentralized blockchain network focused on interoperability, and ICX is the native cryptocurrency. If you stake ICX in a supported wallet, you'll earn regular staking rewards, based on ICON's variable reward rate (currently 10.41% per year).
  <br /><br />
  On Balanced, you can use ICX as collateral to borrow synthetic assets, like Balanced Dollars.`,
